                The Monday Night Customs Team has heard your voices on
                progression in our custom games. Things like difficulty in
                increasing MMR despite winning games and stagnant rankings are
                just some of the feedback we’ve gotten.

                As a result, we are excited to announce something new…

                This will be a <b>timed event that occurs over 3 months</b>,
                which will allow players to try to climb and do their best
                before the season “resets” and the next season begins!

                Moving forward, a{' '}

                Season Power Ranking
            </h1>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                How are players going to be ranked in each season?
            </p>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                As part of seasons, we are introducing the concept of{' '}
                <b>“Season Power Ranking”</b>, or “SPR” for short. SPR will be
                driven by a different algorithm than existing MMRs. Moving
                forward, a new “Leaderboard” on the MNC hub will be the go-to
                place to track your progression throughout the season and
                compare how well you are doing.
            </p>

                </Tag>
            </Flex>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                SPR will only be finalized after you{' '}
                <b>complete 30 qualifying games</b>. SPRs that aren’t
                “qualified” by the end of the season won’t count! They’ll still
                appear on the leaderboard so players can know how much they are
                changing, but will be deprioritized and shown at the end of the
                list. With a season lasting 3 months, there will be plenty of
                time to play for a “qualified” spot on the leaderboard.
            </p>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                Know that after your SPR is "qualified", your SPR can still
                change! 30 games is just the minimum number of games to get your
                rank counted for the season.
            </p>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                For all the players who enjoy the concept of MMR over all of
                your games, don’t worry, the lifetime MMRs will continue to be
                calculated and viewed on the player overview pages. MMR however
                does not have any effect on the placement you have on the
                leaderboard.

                So why qualify for a season and get ranked? Well we are also
                excited to announce <b>Accolades</b>! Accolades are things you
                can earn by completing various tasks across your Monday Night
                Customs games. What are some Accolades you can earn? Well to
                start, the player profiles are getting a little bit of a
                cleanup, and with that we are excited to introduce{' '}
                <b>Player Badges</b>. These are just the first of many possible
                Accolades you can earn by accomplishing tasks throughout the
                season, and they will appear on your profile.
