                Hey everyone! Congratulations on completing our first ever MNC
                Season! There were some incredible games and moments, and we
                want to thank everyone who participated!

                Season 1 Qualifying Games Adjustment
            </h1>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                A notable change on the end of season rewards is that due to the
                changes on Howling Abyss and unexpected participation rates
                during winter holiday, we've decided to reduce the number of
                required qualifying games to <b>20 games</b>.
            </p>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                This ended up adding a few more folks who were right at the edge
                of qualifying into having their scores included on the
                leaderboard. Congrats!
            </p>

                Monday Night Classic Coming Soon!
            </h1>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                And as one last reminder, the Monday Night Classic is still
                planned for a date in March. If you are interested in some
                Summoner's Rift action, make sure to RSVP!
